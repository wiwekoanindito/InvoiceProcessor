# InvoiceProcessor
Process Invoice from DV360

## Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Project Structure
The structure of the working directory should be:
 
```
Main.ipynb
/CSV
/Clean
```

- **/CSV** — contains all raw invoice data from DV360.  
- **/Clean** — stores all processed invoice files.  
- The merged output file (if generated) will be saved in the **main directory**.  

## Usage
Run the code starting from the **Script** section in `Main.ipynb`.  
The **Notebook** section is intended only for experimentation and testing.
